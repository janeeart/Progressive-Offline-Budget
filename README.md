## Description
I added functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. 
  
## Usage
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
  
## Installation
The user will run ```npm start``` in the terminal to run the project locally on their computer.
